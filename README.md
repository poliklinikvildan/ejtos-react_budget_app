## Version
1.0

## Date
18.06.2023

## Dependencies
This project is built using React, Node.js, and HTML. Please refer to the `package.json` file for a complete list of dependencies and their versions.

The project download zip file does not contain node_modules and package-lock.json files. However, to view the project on example port 3000, node_modules folder and package-lock.json are required dependencies. To install these dependencies, follow these steps:

Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. 

Run the following command in the terminal to create a new React app, which will generate the necessary files and folders including the node_modules and package-lock.json files:

```bash
npx create-react-app budget-allocator
```
Above command will create a new React app named "budget-allocator" and install the required dependencies.

Delete almost all the contents, folders, files of the "budget-allocator" folder, keeping only the node_modules folder and package-lock.json file.

Replace the deleted contents of budget-allocator with the contents of the zip file provided in this react_budget_app.

Once all the files and folders are combined as shown in the VS Code editor screenshot above, one can run the project folder using the following command in a terminal or command prompt:
```bash
npm start
```

Bootstrap is another dependency for `react_budget_app` development. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides pre-designed components, responsive layout grids, and CSS stylesheets, making it easier to create visually appealing and mobile-friendly web pages.

To include Bootstrap, one can use package managers like npm to install it as a dependency in the project. Run the following command to install Bootstrap:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```
then
```bash
npm start
```
